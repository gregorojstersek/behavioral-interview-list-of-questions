## Why Behavioral Interviews?

Behavioral interviews are a great addition to understanding the candidate deeply on their motivations and overall fit within the company's culture and mission.

The goal is to assess their previous experience and learnings -> the focus is on learnings. We all have had previous bad experiences, the importance is on how fast did the candidate learn from them.

It’s important to note that this type of interview is not limited to engineering roles only. It can be used for a variety of different roles.

## Behavioral Interview Process

It’s important to have the structure well prepared before starting an interview.

I recommend having the interview last around 60 min. The structure should be as follows:

- **A brief introduction and overview of the interview (5-10 min)**

A quick introduction from the interviewer and the candidate. Make sure that the atmosphere is set correctly.

- **Discussion on experience and learnings (45-50 min)**

Ask open-ended questions and follow-up questions. Always keep in mind the criteria for assessing the answers. Pick questions, that can help you with the accuracy of your assessment most.

- **Candidate's questions (5-10 min)**

It’s important to take time to answer any questions from the candidate. This ensures that both sides have all the relevant information to proceed to the next step.

## Assessing the Answers

The answers should be in line with the STAR method - **S**ituation, **T**ask, **A**ction, **R**esult. 

Always keep that in mind when assessing answers and asking follow-up questions if the answer does not give you the expected outcome. 

Some great follow-up questions are:

- What was the impact you had?
- What would you do differently?
- Any lessons learned?

## Tips for Getting the Relevant Information

When the candidate is answering questions, there is a good chance that the answer will not exactly fit your expectations. 

Make sure to be aware of the next signs:

1. **It’s unclear what responsibility the candidate had in the situation**
   
The candidate talks only about the team and not explicitly about what role he/she had in the situation.

*Follow-up questions: What role did you have in this project? / What did the collaboration look like with others?*

2. **The answer is not going in the right direction**
   
The candidate is drifting in a different direction or avoiding the answer.

*Repeat or rephrase the question a bit differently to ensure that the candidate firmly understands what is expected.*

3. **The candidate is selling instead of stating the facts**
   
That’s your feeling based on their answer.

*Ask a follow-up question to be more specific with the situation, what they have learned, and what they would do differently. This will assure you that the candidate knows exactly what they are talking about.*

4. **Too generic answer**
   
Very generic answer, without details and examples in a hypothetical way.

*Ask a follow-up question or ask them to be more specific about their situation.*

5. **Hard time answering the question**
   
The candidate is struggling with the question.

*Don’t put additional pressure on the candidate, give them time instead. If there would not be any progress on the answer, move on to the next questions and return to this one again later.*

6. **Not possible to assess based on the answer**
   
The candidate did answer your question, but you are unable to assess the answer.

*Always have a backup/follow-up question prepared to ensure you can assess correctly.*
